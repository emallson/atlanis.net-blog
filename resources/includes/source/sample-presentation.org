* What is Beamer?
  
  - LaTeX styles for presentations
  - Exports to PowerPoint-style presentation format
    
* What is Org-mode?

  - Emacs major-mode for organized thought
  - Spiritual successor to =outline-mode=
  - Supports wide variety of markup
    - /italic/, *bold*, =code=, ~verbatim~, etc.
    - Inline LaTeX (including math!)
  - Can export to LaTeX, HTML, and other formats
    
* How Do I Work This Thing?

  - Edit text
  - Export to PDF
    - Intermediate LaTeX file is created and saved
    - This allows all the fine-grained tweaking of LaTeX -- optionally
  - Unfortunately, the difficult bit remains: giving the presentation
