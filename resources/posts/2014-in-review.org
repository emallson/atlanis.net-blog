2014 was a big year for me. More opportunities presented themselves, more
things changed, and more events occurred than in any time of my life
prior. It's time for me to review some of the big points; to reflect on what
went well and what didn't.

* Interning at IBM

  When I applied for internships in December of 2013, I wasn't sure what would
  happen. I applied to big names -- Google, Microsoft, IBM, and others as I did
  the year prior. In 2012-2013, I got no responses. In 2013-2014, I got
  many. My applications to both Google and IBM were accepted, Riot Games asked
  for an interview (which I unfortunately had to decline because I'd already
  accepted IBM's offer), and Microsoft ignored my existence (maybe because my
  resum√© is slathered in Linux tooling and has not a whiff of Microsoft on it).

  I struggled for weeks with the decision between Google and IBM. Working at
  Google is a dream job, but there was a catch: the project I would be working
  on there was boring. Meanwhile, the project I was offered at IBM was really
  cool and exciting. At the time, it involved significant open-source
  contributions. Although it changed later, the change helped refine the
  project goals and clarify what my team would be doing.

  In the end, I chose IBM. I was both looking forward to and dreading starting
  there at the end of May. What if I had chosen incorrectly? Once we got
  started, however, all my doubt vanished. The project turned out to be just as
  exciting as it had sounded. Even better: I had the pleasure of working with a
  phenomenal group of people. On the IBM side, we had a fantastic manager ([[https://twitter.com/rossgrady][Ross
  Grady]]) and great support from the group we were working with.

  On the intern side, things couldn't have been better. My team was phenomenal:
  John and Walker were (and are) great technically, and all four of us (me,
  John, Walker, and Chris) worked together without even a hint of an issue
  throughout the Summer. What's more, I was surprised at how welcome I felt in
  the intern group. I've never been very comfortable socially, and yet by the
  end of the Summer there is but one that I'd not call a friend.

  The biggest benefit of the internship for me was not the technical knowledge
  I gained, the skills I developed, money I made. It was the opportunity to
  work with these people. Prior to this, I had never had the chance to work
  with other programmers. I'd worked in a research lab, but that is a very
  different focus. Seeing how capable my fellow interns were and realizing that
  I was actually capable of keeping up with them was a tremendous confidence
  boost for me.

  I have no regrets about my decision to work at IBM this past Summer. I came
  out of it knowing more, having more friends and contacts, and with several
  offers for positions at IBM. I ended up declining all of them to pursue a
  PhD, but set up an internship with one of the security software teams for
  Summer 2015.

* The Interview

  In the middle of the Summer, I got a wholly unexpected phone call: a Google
  recruiter contacted me about interviewing for a full-time position. At the
  time, my plans for the future were undecided but leaning heavily towards the
  pursuit of a PhD. I told him that I would be willing to talk more after the
  Summer ended, when I had more time.

  When I followed up with him in August/September, things moved rapidly. I was
  able to skip the phone interviews because I'd done well enough on the ones
  for the internship to receive an offer. I got to fly to California and do
  interview in person! Working full-time at Google requires passing a high bar,
  so being interviewed indicates that I may be close to it.

  In the end, I did not receive an offer. However, I was thrilled at the
  thought that I might be capable of reaching and surpassing the skill level
  needed for entry. This also forced me to mentally work out how to deal with
  serious rejection. I have been generally successful throughout my life, and
  hadn't had any rejection on this level before. I am glad that it came at a
  time when I had the opportunity to stop and think about it, rather than a
  super-busy season.

* The Fulbright Program

  I also began working on an application to the [[http://us.fulbrightonline.org/][Fulbright U.S. Student Program]]
  in the summer. This program -- if I were accepted -- would let me study at a
  school almost anywhere in the world. The program grant covers one year, but I
  will be able to build a case for financial aid and visa for continuing on
  should I desire.

  The application for this is for the most part not too bad. However, the two
  essays that go along with it (Personal Statement & Statement of Purpose) were
  especially difficult. I had never written anything like them before and was
  ill-prepared to do so. The advisor at UK was incredibly helpful in this, and
  I believe that I ended up with a competitive application. Regardless, I spent
  a solid month and a half thinking about nothing else. This prepared me well
  to write the statements for grad school applications, but was a significant
  time sink.

  The worst part about this application is that I won't know the result until
  March of this year, while the deadline was September of last year. The long
  waiting period is killer, and is a problem I am facing in other areas as
  well.

* Graduate School Applications

  This is where I made my biggest mistake of the year: I did not work on grad
  school applications on Thanksgiving break. I took the week off: I slept, I
  played video games, I wrote code. I did not apply to grad school. Because of
  this, I was ill-prepared to meet the popular 15 December deadline. I was more
  prepared to meet the 1 January deadline that others have, but between the
  insanity of finals week (15-20 Dec.) and Christmas, ended up being largely
  tardy with that as well. (Also, far fewer schools have the later deadline)

  I learned in 2012/2013 not to wait so long. I made a point of doing
  internship applications in '13 on Thanksgiving break so as to not miss
  deadlines. I learned the lesson, and then in arrogance forgot it. I applied
  to four schools: MIT, Texas A&M, UFlorida and UKansas. I have already been
  accepted into UKansas (0.0), but we'll see what happens.

  I probably won't hear back from the other three schools until mid-March. I
  will have little enough time to make a decision, and will have to start
  planning for the Fall immediately. What really gets me is simply the waiting
  period. I do not know what will happen. I cannot realistically make /any/
  plans for or assumptions about after the summer until March. It sucks. I
  don't like it.

* Goals for 2014

  I didn't really set goals for 2014. One that I stumbled upon through
  meditation on Tom Shear's (Assemblage 23) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dazr7c5a_x9c][Otherness]]. This is a long-term
  goal: be a better person. I started trying to write down a concrete list of
  this while writing this blog post, but I will need to think about it more. I
  realize how incredibly wishy-washy 'be a better person' is, and need to nail
  it down so I know what I'm going for. Details will be a blog post sometime in
  the next week.

* Looking Forward: Goals for 2015

  I am not a fan of New Years resolutions, and thus have none. However, over
  the course of last semester I became of several deficiencies in my overall
  behavior. In particular: my aversion to lists and my inconsistency.

  Lists are helpful tools, yet I often do not use them. I saw how my dad became
  dependent on his lists to remember things and suppose I overreacted. I
  started keeping lists of assignments and due dates during this semester, and
  it helped reduce the number of times that I missed an assignment due to
  forgetfulness.

  This is one method of moving towards my present goal: becoming more
  consistent. Self-discipline is not one of my strong points, but I have been
  working on improving. The impact of this will be better control over what I
  buy, what I eat, and how I spend my time. It meshes well with my goal of 'be
  a better person' (lol), as control will allow me to be who I want to be.

  I have a long way to go.
