I've been playing WoW for a long, long time. Too long, some would say. Not long
enough, others would contend. I began playing around patch 2.4, played through
Wrath (but missed most of the content -- altaholics unite!) and ended up getting
a new account for the start of Cataclysm.

When I began in Cata, I was starting fresh. I had nothing from my old account, I
was on a new realm and knew nobody. I [[us.battle.net/wow/en/character/korgath/Nimun/][leveled a Hunter]] because I wanted to try
out this new-fangled 'focus' thing. For professions, I chose Herbalism and
Inscription because I wanted to make some gold while leveling. I'd never played
the AH game before and had no idea how significantly Cata's changes were going
to impact the Inscription profession. But that's how everything starts, right?
With ignorance?

It's been several years now since I began working with Inscription. With this
post, I want to summarize how it is, how it was and how its changed.

* Leveling
  I have to say that I lucked out. People recommend /Leatherworking/ for Hunters
  -- a profession which had such a painful leveling curve that I had to blow
  several thousand gold just to reach BC content with my sanity intact. By
  comparison, Inscription is a cake-walk. Even better: starting at about 50
  skill, you can start making things that the people with gold both want and
  need.

  Herbs are sort of odd compared to Leather, Cloth and Ore. Each 'tier' of herbs
  has several different plants. For Alchemy, this can mean that you end up with
  a ton of herbs that are on the right skill range, but be unable to make
  anything because you're missing others from the skill range. Thankfully,
  Inscription doesn't suffer from this problem. Even better, all Glyphs have a
  multi-skillups for the first couple made! This meant that my Inscription skill
  kept up with my level and I was at 525 almost as soon as I hit 85.

* Endgame? Not quite
  I wasn't really interested in serious gold making when I first reached 85. I
  had plenty of gold from leveling two characters to afford 280% flying and
  considered 310% flying a luxury not worth the cost. I spent most of my time
  PvPing, dungeon-gearing my DK, and leveling alts.

  I tried to keep a few glyphs on the AH and made sure to /ALWAYS/ do my daily
  research. Unfortunately, Books of Glyph Mastery were incredibly expensive
  (800-2000g) so I was limited to what Northrend and Minor Research could
  give. The process of continuously reposting what few glyphs I had was
  frustrating. I wasn't bringing in much gold and I didn't know why.

  Looking back now, I have had a hard time figuring out why I got into the
  AH. Everything was set against me. What drew me in? Two things: boredom and
  economy. My arena partner was busy with RL and I wasn't into raiding. I did
  BGs and heroic dungeons (which, in those days, were still relatively hard with
  random pugs). One day, I was bored and decided to try to do something with my
  latent Inscriptionist powers.

  I had already been considering doing so because most important glyphs were
  going for the absurd prices of 250-500g. This is around the upper end of
  glyphs I'm selling /at the end of the subsequent expansion!/ So I took my
  boredom and my sense of justice started down the path I am on today: the path
  of the Scribe.

* Enter: TradeSkillMaster
  Google very quickly led me to a new (to me, at least) addon that was very
  quickly displacing Auctioneer as the de-facto standard of auctioneering:
  TradeSkillMaster. I downloaded it, spent an afternoon setting it up, and
  proceeded to make about a bajillion glyphs.

  They sold.

  Read that again: /they sold!/ Not all of them, of course. Not even a
  significant fraction of them sold, but enough did that I pulled a thousand
  gold out of the mailbox the next morning. At the time, that was big money for
  me. I took the gold and immediately spent it all on herbs to mill. I nearly
  doubled the amount of glyphs I had up. More sold. Then more and more. At my
  peak in Cata, I was bringing in around 8k per day just from glyphs. I
  restocked daily and drove the competiton out of the market with greatly
  reduced prices -- my cap for most of the expansion was 100g per glyph -- and
  persistence.

* Burnout
  Alas, it was not to last. I got burnt out on WoW. I played less and less. I
  stopped restocking, which resulted in sales dropping to a trickle. Others
  moved in on my market. And I let them have it.

  I quit playing around the start of MoP, came back for a brief stint in
  mid-5.2, and left again after getting effectively 2-shot by a DK in an
  arena. I just started playing again this past January because of the free
  transfer off of Darkspear and over to Korgath (which doesn't have a 4:1 A:H
  ratio). More importantly, two close friends of mine were starting to play
  again. But, they were rerolling on a new realm! As Alliance!

  I rolled with them and -- while my stubborn refusal to use heirlooms has
  slowed my progress -- have been greatly enjoying it. I had [[http://www.reddit.com/r/woweconomy/comments/1y7sbm/help_dealing_w_highly_competitive_market_on_a/][tried and failed]] to
  get back into the glyph market. My utter failure really stymied my enthusiasm
  for the game. I enjoyed crafting and selling glyphs. It was (and is) a lot of
  fun for me. Inscription is different from every other profession, and now I
  was going to have to find something else.

  I tried selling glyphs on my Ally realm, but was bitten by the fact that
  Inscription sales scale with glyph variety. I didn't have the resources or
  recipes to make much gold with it. I spent thousands of gold and tons of time
  getting Inscription to the point I had it on Korgath; I didn't want to start
  again. Even more: transferring my Hunter was (and is) not an option. Why?
  [[http://www.wowhead.com/item%3D46814#comments][/That bloody dragonhawk!/]] However, everything changed this past Monday.

** From 0 to 90 in $60
   The sudden availability of the level 90 boosts took me by surprise. When I
   got home on Monday, I followed my instincts. Despite my failure, despite my
   lack of variety, I went and reposted all of my glyphs.

   I made 4000g. I've averaged 6000g per day over the past week. To keep up with
   sales, I had to set up TSM's deal-finding notifications in order to buy what
   few reasonably-priced herbs pop up on the AH. My competition has almost
   completely vanished. The only remaining contender has a woefully inadequate
   stock, even compared to my paltry amount. My sales are continuing to
   increase.

* The Way Forward
   My goal right now is to do something that I've never managed once to do: get
   a complete restock. 3 of every glyph on the AH, 20 of every glyph total. I
   got close in Cata, but still never managed it. Now, I have the bank space, I
   have the gold flow, I have the recipes (except for timeless -- screw
   timeless), and this coming week I will have the time. The only thing missing
   is the herbs.

   I've been buying everything that I can and am still only barely managing to
   keep my stock above 400 glyphs (peaking at ~650) -- far short of the ~1300
   I'll have with a full restock. Deals are being made, hopefully it will help.
