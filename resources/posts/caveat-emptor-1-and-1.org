In August of last year, I purchased this domain (atlanis.net) using [[https://www.1and1.com/][1&1]] as a
registrar. I admit, I did not do my homework. I'd dealt with them before as part
of my work, so I didn't feel the need to. Bad decision.

This past week, I decided to move my domain from 1&1 to [[https://www.namecheap.com][namecheap]]. While the
transfer hasn't yet completed, I want to lay out some of the reasons for this
decision as a warning to others who may look at 1&1 for domain registration in
the future.

TL;DR Version: Avoid 1&1.

* Sub-domain Limit
  I can only have 5 sub-domains with 1&1. This is actually what prompted me to
  look for options in the first place. I already have 5 subs (forumite.,
  static., media., mail., and another for work), but I wanted one for this very
  blog. I was unable to find any way to either create additional subdomains
  manually (by editing DNS records) or even a way to purchase more (not that I
  would have).

* Higher Prices
  The price for a =.net= domain at 1&1 is ~15$/year, while at namecheap it is
  ~12$/year. Not much difference, but I feel like I'm paying *more* for *less*.

* Bad Interface
  These are really just annoyances, but they did contribute to my decision:

  - Slow

    Loading the Domain Center (even after having everthing in cache!) takes a
    whopping /12 seconds!/ After loading, every operation takes several seconds
    to change states.

  - Blocked by AdBlock+

    I really don't know how 1&1 managed this one, but they did. The Domain
    Center is blocked (in its entirety!) by the AdBlock+ extension, which means
    that I have to disable it on 1&1's site (which isn't a big deal; 1&1 doesn't
    serve ads on its site).

  These things don't reflect any sort of quality. There is no reason the
  interface needs to take so long to load, and there is no reason for it to be
  built in such a way as to trigger ad blockers!

* No Multi-Factor Authentication
  Call me paranoid, but I don't trust single-factor authentication for much of
  anything. 1&1 has no multi-factor option (although they /definitely/ had my
  phone number). On the other hand, when I registered at namecheap one of the
  first prompts was to set up multi-factor using my phone as the second
  factor. Definitely made me feel better about it.

* Spam Calls
  Here is the real kicker. Arbitrary limits? OK. Marginally higher prices?
  OK. Slow, ugly interface? OK. /Spam-calling your customers every day even after
  being told they're not interested?/ *NOT OK!*

  Here's a nice screenshot from my phone showing what I dealt with:

  [[https://atlanis.net/media/blog/1-and-1-spam-log.png]]

  I had to stop it by /changing my phone number on the 1&1 site!/ Not cool! I'm
  not the only one who's had this problem. For example:
  https://www.facebook.com/1and1/posts/10151313042057931

  In my opinion, any company that spams me is not worth dealing with. The only
  reason I waited this long was because of general business. Now I'm dealing
  with the problem, but one question remains.

* Why namecheap?
  In a word: [[http://lifehacker.com/5944127/most-popular-domain-name-registrar-namecheap?tag=hive-five][Lifehacker]]. I read the comments and weighed the options. While that
  post is a couple of years old, the namecheap site actually inspired way more
  confidence in my than the 1&1 one (which I could swear is from 2001) ever did.

  My transfer is due to complete on the 12th of this month. Here's hoping I
  won't have any trouble with namecheap.
