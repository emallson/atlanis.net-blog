I was reading [[http://emacsredux.com/blog/2014/03/01/a-peek-at-emacs-24-dot-4-delete-duplicate-lines/][this wonderful post]] on the new =delete-duplicate-lines= function
that is being introduced in Emacs 24.4 and asked myself the question: why stop
at lines? Therefore, I make the following proposals:

* Rename =delete-duplicate-lines= to =de-duplicate=
  You'll understand why soonâ„¢.

* Deleting Duplicate Forms
  How often have you been maintaining some code and found the same function
  implemented in 3 different places? Wouldn't it be wonderful to have some way
  to fix that? Using the magic of emacs, apply the =C-u C-u C-u C-u= prefix to
  remove it!

  For example:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  (defun foo (x y)
    (+ x y))

  (defun bar (y z)
    (- (* 2 y z) (* (1- y) z) (* y (1- z)))
  #+END_SRC

  Becomes:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  (defun foo (x y)
    (+ x y))
  #+END_SRC

  The function that has a smaller parse tree should be chosen.

* Deleting Duplicate Statements
  Why stop with lisp forms? Why not =de-duplicate= papers to remove needless
  cruft and repetition? Well, with the =C-u C-u C-u C-u C-u= prefix you could!

  Using the quintuple =C-u= prefix on Obama's NSA reform speech transcript gives
  us:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Our intelligence agencies will continue to gather information
  #+END_QUOTE

  Miraculous!

* Getting Philosophical
  As the oft-quoted proverb[fn:proverb] says, "there is nothing new under the
  sun". Clearly, therefore, everything is a duplicate of something that has
  already been done! With the sextuple =C-u= (that's =C-u C-u C-u C-u C-u C-u=,
  for those keeping track at home), we of the free software community can
  finally come to terms with nihilistic philosophy!

  As an example, running =C-u C-u C-u C-u C-u C-u de-duplicate= on this org
  document produces:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  \nbsp
  #+END_QUOTE

  By R'lyeh, am I glad that =M-x revert-buffer= exists!

* In Closing
  I'm hoping to get these extensions in for Emacs 24.5. Until then, you can get
  the code off of [[https://gist.github.com/emallson/9380265][github]].

[fn:proverb] It actually comes from /Ecclesiastes/, not /Proverbs/. This
footnote exists only because the internet was made for nitpicking.
